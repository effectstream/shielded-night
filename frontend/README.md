# ShieldedNight Frontend — NIGHT ⇄ wNIGHT DEX

A browser dApp for the ShieldedNight contract: convert native unshielded **NIGHT**
into the shielded wrapper **wNIGHT** and back. Connects to any `window.midnight[*]`
wallet, reads shielded + unshielded balances, and targets preview / preprod
(mainnet later) via a network dropdown.

Vite + React 18 + TypeScript. Adapted from the `midnight-wallet-dapp` reference.

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
bun install
bun run dev               # http://localhost:5173
```

Requires the contract's compiled artifacts at `../src/managed` (run `bun run compact`
in the repo root if missing). Vite serves them at `/contract/compiled/shielded-night`
so the browser proof step can fetch prover/verifier keys.

## Configuration (`.env`)

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PREVIEW_ADDRESS` / `PREPROD_ADDRESS` / `MAINNET_ADDRESS` / `UNDEPLOYED_ADDRESS` | Deployed contract address per network (the dropdown shows only networks with an address set). |

The wallet supplies the indexer / node / proof-server URLs (`getConfiguration()`)
and owns proving; the dApp only needs the contract address per network. The
wNIGHT token type is derived from the address.

**`.env` is committed.** It holds only public on-chain addresses, so the
deployed address per network lives in git history (each redeploy is a commit).
Secrets never go in it - deploy scripts read `MN_MNEMONIC` / `MN_SEED` from the
shell environment. For personal overrides use `.env.local` (gitignored; Vite
loads it over `.env`).

## How it works

Each conversion is **two transactions** with a pool credit keyed by a
client-generated secret held between them. One **Swap** click orchestrates both
legs (two wallet approvals) with a step indicator:

- **NIGHT → wNIGHT**: `depositUnshielded(secret, amount)` → `withdrawShielded(secret, amount, myCoinPublicKey, nonce)`.
- **wNIGHT → NIGHT**: `depositShielded(secret, coin)` → `withdrawUnshielded(secret, coin.value, myAddress)`.

The secret and any minted wrapper coin are persisted to `localStorage`, so an
interrupted swap can be resumed (see the "Unfinished swaps" panel) and minted
wNIGHT can be converted back later.

### Reverse-direction limitation (read this)

The `window.midnight` connector exposes only **aggregate** shielded balances — it
does not reveal individual coins or their nonces. `depositShielded` needs the
exact `ShieldedCoinInfo{nonce, color, value}`. So **wNIGHT → NIGHT works only for
wrapper coins this dApp minted in this browser** (tracked in `localStorage`). The
reverse UI is enabled regardless; if there is no tracked coin it surfaces a clear
error rather than failing silently. Converting arbitrary/received wNIGHT would
require a coin-level wallet API that does not exist today. The reverse swap
converts a whole tracked coin at a time (remainder-free).

## Verify end-to-end (needs a deployed contract + a Midnight wallet)

1. `bun run dev`; install a Midnight wallet extension set to **preview**.
2. Put the preview contract address in `.env`, reload.
3. Click **Connect wallet** (top-right) → approve. Balances panel shows NIGHT + wNIGHT.
4. Enter an amount, **Swap NIGHT → wNIGHT**, approve both prompts → wNIGHT balance rises.
5. Flip direction, **Swap wNIGHT → NIGHT** (converts a dApp-minted coin) → NIGHT rises.

## Build

```bash
bun run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
bun run build       # vite build → dist/
```

The build bundles the ledger/runtime WASM and copies the contract artifacts. The
ledger WASM is ~10 MB and prover keys are multi-MB — expect a large first load,
cached by the browser afterward.
